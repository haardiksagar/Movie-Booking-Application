/*## Me:
meaning this will not load the data related to the specific shows in the list instead we will only see the list of shows and to access the data of a specific show, it needs to be done explicitly

## AI Assistant:
Yes, your understanding is correct. When you use `fetch = FetchType.LAZY`:

- The **list of shows** (`List<Show>`) related to the specific `Movie` will not be loaded immediately when you fetch the `Movie` entity from the database.
- Instead, a **proxy object** (or a placeholder for the `List<Show>`) will be created. This proxy will act as a reference to the related data but will not load the actual records.
- To access the actual data of the related `Show` entities, it will need to be fetched explicitly by accessing the list or iterating through it in your code. At that point, the database query to fetch the related `Show` entities will be triggered.

This mechanism helps optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary database queries when you donâ€™t explicitly need the related data.
